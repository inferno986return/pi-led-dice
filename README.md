# pi-led-dice

A very WIP project to create a LED die with the Raspberry Pi, inspired by the [Velleman MK109](https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=338494). I plan to use a breadboard, jumper cables and 7 red LEDs in a "H" configuration, similar to other [Cotswold Jam](http://www.cotswoldjam.org/) tutorials.
